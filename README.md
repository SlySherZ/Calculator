# Calculator
Command line based calculator, with support for arbitrary expressions, advanced math functions and variables

## Compile
Open 'Calculator.sln' file with Visual Studio and build either Debug or Release version.
I tested it with Visual Studio 2015.

## Run
Simply open the executable, type the expression you want to calculate and press enter.
The executable should be in the same directory as the 'Help.txt' and 'Patch Notes.txt' so that you are able to use '\help' and '\patchnotes' commands.

## Background
This project was one of my first C++ projects, which started by following Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming Principles and Practice Using C++. I went my own way after a while, which makes my version quite different from the one taught in the book.
This is somewhat old and needs an update to meet my current coding stardards :)
